# RustyBunny
This is a prototype of a very simple Remote Access Trojan (RAT) complete with C2C nodes that the RAT can dynamically switch between for instructions.

I'm implementing the initial version of this project in Python for ease of prototyping, but I will be porting it to Rust later on for speed and smaller executable size.
